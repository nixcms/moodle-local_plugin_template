# Dashboard Viewed Event

## Overview
The `dashboard_viewed` event is a custom logging event triggered whenever a user accesses their dashboard in Moodle. This event has been added as part of the **local_high_five** plugin to demonstrate how to log and track user actions using Moodle's event and logging APIs.

## How It Works
1. The event is defined in the file:
    - `classes/event/dashboard_viewed.php`
2. The event is triggered in the `lib.php` file when the dashboard page (`/my`) is accessed:
    - Function: `local_high_five_extend_navigation()`
3. The event is logged into the Moodle logs (`mdl_logstore_standard_log`) and can be viewed in:
    - **Site administration > Reports > Logs**
